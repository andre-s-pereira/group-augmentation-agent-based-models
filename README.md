# Group augmentation agent-based models
The most comprehensive agent-based model from Andr√© Pereira's 2024 PhD Thesis. From this agent-based model, we can create all other models presented in Chapters 3 and 4 of Andre's thesis by simplifying the mechanism (e.g., removing the multigenerational aspect; fixating "harshness" for each simulation; etc) or excluding chunks of code according to the description in the methods of each chapter (e.g., excluding the step of recruitment of immigrants if we are modelling the strategy "only reproduce"; etc).
Files in the repository include:
1. R script with code to create the R function that runs the agent-based model
2. R script with code to call the function and run the model
